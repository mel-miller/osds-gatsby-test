This demo site is built with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="osds-link">Gatsby</a> to test the implementation of OSDS components. The stylesheet was added via the CDN and the markup was created via React Components.

<h2 class="section-header">Components</h2>

At this time the following components have example pages:

<ul className="osds-list-ul">
  <li className="osds-list-item">
    <Link className="osds-link" to="/accordions">
      Accordions
    </Link>
  </li>
  <li className="osds-list-item">
    <Link className="osds-link" to="/alerts">
      Alerts
    </Link>
  </li>
  <li className="osds-list-item">
    <Link className="osds-link" to="/buttons">
      Buttons
    </Link>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-header">Implementation</h2>

There are many ways to implement OSDS into a Gatsby project. This demo site uses
the following methods:

CSS is implemented by importing the hosted CSS file into a global stylesheet for the project.

```css
@import url("https://assets.osu.edu/osds/v0.x/css/osds-styles.min.css");
```

<br />

JS is implemented by importing the hosted JS file into the `gatsby-ssr.js` file
for the project. This will place the script at the bottom of the `<body>` element.

```js
import React from "react"

export const onRenderBody = ({ setPostBodyComponents }) => {
  setPostBodyComponents([
    <script src="https://assets.osu.edu/osds/v0.x/js/osds.min.js" />,
  ])
}
```
